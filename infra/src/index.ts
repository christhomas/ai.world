 * on the machine it built it on. Point an existing stack at a different host and it reconciles the
 * new machine against the old one's memory: it believes the file is already there because it wrote
 * it, on a box across the room. New machine, new stack, without exception.
 *
 * Nothing here describes the whole machine, and it is not meant to. Anything not modelled is left
 * exactly as it is, which is what makes this safe to point at a server that already works and has
 * been hand-tended for years.

 * being root, which it never is.
 *
 * It runs one file. `server/build.config.ts` already rolls the whole server into a single
