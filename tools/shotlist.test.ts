/**
 * That a shot is taken in a world containing the thing it photographs.
 *
 * `chore shots mountain` never took a picture. Not once, in the whole life of the shot: there is no
 * `docs/screenshots/mountain.png` in this repository's history. Every run said the same thing —
 *
 *     missed mountain     nothing to photograph in this world today
 *
 * — because every shot in `shots.cjs` falls back to `world: 'road'` and this one had no world of
 * its own. A road-tree world is not `shaped`, so its high ground is `massifs`, and `planMassifs`
 * puts none on seed 3; `ranges` is null there by construction. Both of the things the shot's search
 * reads are therefore empty in the world it was being taken in.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because a shot that finds nothing is not a failure. `missed` is the honest
 * answer for a world that happens not to have a mountain in it today, so a shot that can *never*
 * find one reads exactly like one that is merely unlucky.
 *
 * Read off the source, because a shot is a browser and a world and is not a thing a unit test can
 * run. What can be held is the pairing, and the pairing is the bug.

 * the flag being wrong.

 * `shots.cjs` cannot be imported here — it requires playwright at its first line, which this
 * project deliberately does not depend on and which the `check` job does not install. So the
