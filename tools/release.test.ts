/**
 * Which issues a release gets to claim.
 *
 * The rule is a window, not a guess: everything closed since the previous tag went out is in this
 * release, because there was no other release for it to have gone out in. The edges are what this
 * watches — an issue closed before the previous tag already shipped and must not be stamped twice,
 * and an issue closed at the very moment of the previous tag belongs to the one after it.
